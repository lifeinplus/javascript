<h2>Place superheroes around the soccer field.</h2>

<p>Superheroes and the ball are elements with the class "draggable". Make
    them really draggable.</p>
<p>Important: limit dragging by the window. If a draggable reaches window top
    or bottom, then the page should scroll to let us drag it further.</p>
<p>If your screen is big enough to fit the whole document -- make the window
    smaller to get vertical scrolling, so that you could text it.</p>
<p>In this task it's enough to handle vertical scrolling. There's no
    horizontal scrolling usually, and it's handled the similar way if needed.</p>
<p>And one more thing: heroes may never leave the page. If they reach the
    edge of the document, no dragging outside it.</p>
